Code from COMP 2210 Fundamentals of Computing II. Some code belongs
to Dr. Hendrix (Auburn University) and some to Ryan Santa Ana (Auburn University).
All of my code is under the New BSD license (BSD3). No well cited
documentation is available with this code since it is an archival
and demo push. This is from Fall 2015 at Auburn University.
